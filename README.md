# diva

Diva is a dependency injection framework for GLib-based applications.
Dependencies between classes can be managed so that apllications stay maintainable as they grow.
Diva is designed to be used with the Vala programming language

### Using Diva

#### Registering components

Components that provide services are registered with a ```ContainerBuilder```

    var builder = new ContainerBuilder();
Diva can use a delegate, a type, or an exising instance:

    builder.register<FooService>(ctx => new FooComponent());
    builder.register<FooComponent>().as<FooService>();
    builder.registerInstance<FooService>(new FooComponent());
calling ```Build()``` creates a container

    var container = builder.build();
instances of a service can then be requested using resolve<T>()

    var fooService = container.resolve<FooService>();

#### Expressing dependencies

Dependencies are expressed as public properties of the component

    public class FooComponent : Object, FooService
    {
        public BarService bar { construct; private get; }
    }
When constructing a FooComponent, Diva will look for a component that provides BarService and
set the property bar to a new instance of it.

### Building Diva

Diva utilizes the [Meson build system](https://mesonbuild.com/Quick-guide.html).
To build in the subdirectory `build`:

    $ cd /path/to/source/root
    $ meson build && cd build
    $ ninja
    $ ninja test
